# Brain_tumor_classification

ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained using Transfer Learning, to analyze brain MRI scans. The goal is to assist in the initial triage and screening process by providing a quick, automated classification of potential tumor types. The model was trained on the BRISC 2025 dataset.

Key Features:

- User-Friendly Web Interface: Upload an MRI scan and get an instant prediction.
- Model Explainability: Includes Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize the areas of the image that influenced the model's decision, building trust and verifying results.
- High Accuracy: The model achieves over 95% accuracy on the test set.
